This app enables a user to create and track workouts.  It combines the number of workouts to give a total number of reps, miles, time, weight, etc.  Each time you click "new workout" you start a new workout and add your excercises.  If you click "continue workout" it adds to the current workout.  
This app uses MongoDB for the database to store the information for the workout on the backend.  The connection to the database was a bit tricky through MongoDB Atlas but when all the steps were followed it worked great!
